            <p>  Her real name Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo Calderón.From a young age she went through many situations of sadness and suffering that caused her immobility in various parts of her body but still dedicated her life to which she was trying to develop, painting. In his paintings I always reflect rural people who suffer in a fantasy environment. Thematics of pain, blood, abortions fear of death and suffering was the most typical of his paintings. It was also a woman committed to the world, she was against capitalism by getting involved in the politics of her country.
